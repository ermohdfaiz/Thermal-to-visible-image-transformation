# Thermal-to-visible-image-translation

Deep learning algorithms will be used in the project to produce high-quality visual images from thermal photos.
An overview of the methodology, data collection, and pre-processing procedures is provided in the report.
The SSIM and PSNR measurements were used to assess the model.
The outcomes demonstrate that the suggested method is successful in converting thermal images into realistic and excellent visual images.
This method may be used in a variety of industries, including surveillance, search and rescue, and medical imaging.
